Quick game of tic tac toe made in React. This project assumes you have Node.js installed and are able to run it.

Through this process, I installed various software on my own local system including software such as CodeSandbox and Node.js, and also learned how to set up paths 
to ensure that a newly installed compiler correctly points to vs code. I learned how to use React DevTools through both my local machine and CodeSandbox,
and also learned a lot about implementing the observer pattern. 

What I learned/did with this project:
- Initializing, updating, and rendering components
- Improving the refactorability of my react code
- Learning the importance of immutability in code
- Manipulating the state of my components (setting the state, lifting the state up)

Relatively Low-Level Techy Stuff (for the nerds):
- Utilizing JSX elements
- Implementing CSS classes
- Passing data through props
- Creating interactive components
- Working with my local machine's browser console and dev tools
